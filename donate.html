      New Yorkers throw out 200,000 tons of clothing and textiles every year.
      Instead of throwing your textiles away, donate or recycle them, which helps
      keep New York clean and fashionable.Certain drop-offs only accept specific
      items or their own branded merchandise. Call ahead to ensure your materials
      will be accepted.

      Donate This Recycle That helps keep tens of millions of pounds of usable
      items out of landfills every year. We can assist you with donating your
      gently used items to three worthy charities: Arms of Hope, AMVETS NSF,
      and The National Children’s Cancer Society or assist you with raising
      funds for your own organization. Either way, you are an environmental
      hero!
