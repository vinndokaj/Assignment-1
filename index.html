    <h3>Why you should recycle</h3>
    <p>
      When a material is used to make something, it’s important that it breaks
      down organically, can be reused, or recycled into something else.
      Otherwise, that material only serves one purpose before it ends up in a
      landfill long-term where it will not break down.<br> <br>
      If waste is not recycled, it can negatively impact our environment in
      many ways. Waste can emit greenhouse gases that contribute to global
      warming and, therefore, climate change. Non-recycled waste can contribute
      to air pollution, water pollution, and put animal lives and human lives at
      risk. Alternatively, if we recycle, we can significantly reduce the amount
      of pollution our waste creates.<br> <br>
      Recycling is also crucial because of how waste can impact animals (and
      consequently, humans because, you know, food chain). Waste can cause loss
      of natural habitats and contributes to negative impacts like climate
      change and global warming, which can also destroy animals’ natural
      habitats. When animals — and other biological organisms — lose their
      habitats, they can die off or starve.<br> <br>
      Recycling also means using materials that have already been used, rather
      than creating new raw materials. Since raw materials often come from our
      most important forests, like rainforests for example, recycling can cut
      back on the need for raw materials. Raw materials could also include
      natural resources like timber, water, and minerals. When we cut back on
      new materials, we can preserve natural habitats, forests, rainforests,
      and give the Earth a chance to grow and heal.
